# Local Library

## Introduction
The Local Library application brings the joy and learning of a community library right to your fingertips. Designed to simplify the process of searching, reviewing, and checking out books, our application serves as a bridge between book enthusiasts and the vast resources of their local neighborhood libraries.

The stats dashboard provides a quick overview of library activity, popular books, and authors.

## Technology Stack
- **JavaScript ES6**: Leveraged for its advanced features in creating efficient search and sorting functions, as well as the flexible codebase for easy expansion.
- **Bootstrap**: Used to design a responsive and mobile-friendly interface that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
- **HTML5**: The backbone of the application's structure, ensuring semantic clarity and standards-compliant markup.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment that powers the server-side logic, making the application robust and scalable.

## Features
- **Sorting Options**: Books are sorted by various criteria, including genre, availability, and popularity, to help users make informed choices.
- **Account Information**: Borrowers' information is easily accessible in a dashboard.

## Discoveries
Developing the Local Library was a journey through full-stack development with a focus on the user experience. I learned the importance of creating scalable JavaScript functions and the benefits of integrating Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Future Goals
In the future, I plan to incorporate real-time availability updates and social features to share reviews and reading lists with friends.
