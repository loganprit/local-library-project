# Local Library

## Introduction
Welcome to the Local Library applicationâ€”a digital hub for managing and tracking community library resources. With a focus on streamlining the borrowing process and providing insights into account activity, the Local Library bridges the gap between readers and the expansive collections of their local neighborhoods.

## Technology Stack
- **JavaScript ES6**: For writing clean and efficient code, with the flexibility to expand the library's capabilities.
- **Bootstrap**: To ensure a responsive and visually appealing interface.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content in a semantic and accessible way.
- **Node.js**: Powering the backend for a robust and scalable application.

## Current Features
- **Dashboard Overview**: Gain insights from the dashboard, which shows general stats, most common genres, popular books, and top authors.
- **Account Management**: View details about account holders, including their borrowing history and current books checked out.
- **Book Tracking**: Track the status of books, showing which are returned and the most recent borrowers.

## Usage
Follow these steps to set up the Local Library on your local machine:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Open your web browser and go to the link provided in the terminal to view the application.

## Discoveries
This project was a valuable practice in full-stack development. Working on the Local Library taught me about the intricacies of JavaScript ES6 and the power of Bootstrap, which I used to create a responsive design that enhances the user experience.

## Future Goals
Looking ahead, I aim to add interactive search and sorting capabilities and improve real-time data updates.
